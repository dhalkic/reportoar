## Project description
The intention with this project is to create a website where users can browse and explore upcoming events within Bosnia and Herzegovina. The website will cater to music lovers, festival enthusiasts, and cultural associations who struggle to find all the relevant information about cultural events in one place. It would also add additional focus onto cultural events such as folklore events, hosted by different cultural artistic
associations. The website will feature an interactive and userfriendly interface where visitors can search for upcoming events and get all the necessary information regarding the event, such as date, time, venue, performers.
